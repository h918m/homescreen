Add to Home Screen Floating Layer
=================================

The script places a floating balloon to your mobile website inviting the user to add your app to the home screen. This is compatible with iPhone/4/iPod-touch and iPad, iOS >= 3.1.1.

Version: 0.9.1 beta

## Usage
Include the script and the stylesheet in your page HEAD. That's all. Look at the examples for advanced features. Documentation soon to come.

## Localization
The script auto-detects the user's locale and shows the message in the appropriate language. Currently the following languages are supported:

- English [en_us]: Install this web app on your %device: tap '%icon' and then 'Add to Home Screen'.
- French [fr_fr]: Ajoutez cette application sur votre %device en cliquant sur '%icon', puis 'Ajouter à l'écran d'accueil'.
- Italian [it_it]: Installa questa applicazione sul tuo %device: premi su '%icon' e poi 'Aggiungi a Home'.

**Please help us localizing the script in more languages!**
